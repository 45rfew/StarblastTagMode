# Starblast Tag Mode - Tag This Mode!
by Bhpsngum

## What is Tag Mode?

I've first seen this mode when I play [Diep.io](https://diep.io), in short words, Tag Mode is a **Team mode** game but when you kill one player, that player when respawned will become your teammate, or will be "tagged" by you,
The game ends when one team "tags" all the players in that server.

## Starblast Tag Mode - short description

* Max players: 40
* Number of teams: 4
* Map size: 60
* Map pattern: randomly created by the server
* Team stats and Leaderboard in scoreboard for all players (with team colors!)
* Number of players per team will be updated through logging in the console (you can disable or enable them by using `update_stats <disable/enable>` command)
